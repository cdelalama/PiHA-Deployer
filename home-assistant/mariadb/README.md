# Moved to infrastructure/mariadb/

The MariaDB helper has been relocated. Use the new path:
- Documentation: `infrastructure/mariadb/README.md`
- Bootstrap script: `infrastructure/mariadb/setup-nas-mariadb.sh`

This folder remains only for backward compatibility. Running `setup-nas-mariadb.sh` here will delegate to the new script.
